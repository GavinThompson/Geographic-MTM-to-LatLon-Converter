Using a public data set, I encountered something I've never seen before -- MTM (Modified Transverse Mercator) coordinates. These were not the Latitude/Longitude coords I so desperately needed for Google Maps. MTM appears to be a coordinate system unique to Eastern Canada.

While I found a few (very few) applets where I could do calculate the coords one at a time, I needed something that was somewhat more efficient. 

Major credit for inspiration and starting point with calculations go to:
http://home.hiwaay.net/~taylorc/toolbox/geography/geoutm.html (UTM)
and
http://leware.net/geo/utmgoogleapp.htm (MTM)

If you just need to convert one set of coords, I'd suggest using the tools above. 
If you need to convert 250+ (like I did today), just throw this in your project and refine it to your needs.
